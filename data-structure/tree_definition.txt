1. Degenerate or Pathological Tree:- A degenerate or pathological tree is the tree having a single 
                                     child either left or right.

2. Skewed Binary Tree:- A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is 
                        either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes. Thus, there are two 
                        types of skewed binary tree: left-skewed binary tree and right-skewed binary tree.

3. Balanced Binary Tree:- It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the height of the 
                          left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.
